	* test/hex.t: New module from Mika Laari
	<mikalaari@users.sourceforge.net> to fetch quote information from
	the Helsinki stock exchange.

	and 'isodate' fields based on the retrieved textual date (or lack
	thereof).

	to only divide London exchange values by 100 if they are

	those tests.

	* test/indiamutual.t:
	* test/trustnet.t:
	* test/union.t:
	* test/yahoo.t: Changed test stock to one that is still on the

	* test/za.t: Add a new South African stock quote module from
	Stephen Langenhoven <langenhoven at users.sourceforge.net>.

	calling the user agent GET function.  Fixes bug 747080.

2005-03-19  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* almost all files: Collapsed all date parsing code into a single
	function.  This function handles the date formats provided by all
	current quote sources and converts them all into the F::Q standard
	of a US date format.  It also adds an ISO format date to all
	quotes in the new isodate field.  Added lots of test functions to
	check date formats.


2005-03-19  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	exchanges.

2003-09-15	Pawel Konieczny <konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>
	* AEX module: major update: additional labels for options available:
	volume, oi, and other. Subframes cache implemented, resulting in 
	substantial speedup for repeating (intraday) requests of individual 
	options.


2003-09-12  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* Yahoo/Base.pm: Added suffixes for 1) the US Options, 2) US

	implemented.  POD and test script updated as well.


2003-08-27	Pawel Konieczny	<konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>

	(previously it was returning empty strings in such cases).


2003-07-07	Pawel Konieczny	<konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>

2003-07-06	Pawel Konieczny	<konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Update of F::Q::AEX module: added a remap functionality 
	  which translates the official stock ticker to AEX CGI 
	  symbol

	* Update of F::Q::AEX module: Distiguishing indices and stocks:
	  indices will have "currency" label undefined, stocks will have
	  value "EUR".  This fixes the currency conversion problem for
	  indices.

	* Update of F::Q::AEX module: Cleanup of labels: "offer" renamed to
	  "ask" ("ask" is more common, besides, it can be
	  currency-converted). Label "offer" stays for backward
	  compatibility.

	* Update of F::Q::AEX module: Cleanup of garbage in some fields.
	  (Ocassionally, the http fetch & parse will return garbage for
	  some values).

	* Fixed problem where undefined currencies would be returned
	  as zero, and not undefined as occured in previous versions.

	  could be done between EUR and former European currencies.
	  These are no longer supported due to a change in the
	  lookups provided by Yahoo.

	* Updated Fidelity.pm to indicate its current non-working status.

	* Added T. Rowe Price patches by David Hampton, which provide
	  a troweprice_direct method.  (#666351)

	* As above, for the Fidelity module.  (#666353)

	* Accepted David Hampton's patch to Yahoo currencies.
	  The correct currency will now be flagged on stocks regardless
	  of the module used to grab them. (#666361)

	  First Trust Portfolios L.P.  Thanks to David Hampton
	  (again!) for supplying this. (#670202)

	* Added Ganesan Rajagopal's excellent IndiaMutal module.
	  (#720896)

	* Fixed Cdnfundlibrary to correctly set the success flag
	  when successful.  Thanks to Robert Clark for finding
	  this bug.  (#752395)

	* Updated Tdwaterhouse.pm with Robert Clark's changes to
	  work with the new TD Waterhouse website.  Many thanks
	  to Robert Clark again. (#750843)

	  Clark, including test cases.  (#752423).

	  current functional unhappiness.

2001-12-19	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Added Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Asia to provide lookup of
	  Asian stock quotes (not including Japan).  Many thanks
	  to M.R.Muthu Kumar for this patch.


2001-07-23	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated Yahoo::Europe.pm so that stocks fetched from the

	  Swedish Krona (SEK).


2001-07-04	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Confirmed debian packages release with Ross Peachey.

	* Moved cvs tags in debian/* so that finance_quote_1_06

	  1.05.

	* Added AEX module courtesy of Rob Sessink.

	  shown.

	* Updated Trustnet test because one of the funds we were looking
	  for had changed its name, causing the test to fail.

	* Added AEX test suite to repository.

	* Removed failover into Fool.pm support, as I'd like to do more
	  testing before it enters the failover system.

	* Updated the FAQ.

	* Updated the INSTALL file.

	* Moved regression tests from /t to /test. Updated MANIFEST
	  file accordingly.  This means that autoamtic installs from
	  CPAN won't run the regression tests, which was causing
	  installation to fail on some systems.

	* Updated lists of copyright holders, SEE ALSO sections
	  in man-pages.

	* CVSTAG: finance_quote_1_06


2001-06-25	Linas Vepstas

2001-06-04	Brent Neal	<brentn@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added Jasmin Bertovic's Cdnfundlibrary module.


2001-05-08	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Applied Leigh Wedding's patch to ASX.pm, after ASX changed

	  more. Thanks Leigh.

	  F::Quote.pm.


2001-04-05	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated ASX.pm module to reflect changed location of
	  information on the ASX's website.  (Still doesn't
	  help when the ASX site is totally broken, as is
	  too often the case.)

	* Updated Trustnet.pm module to reflect changes to the
	  Trustnet site.


2001-02-16	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated to repsect formatting changes in data fed to the

2001-12-05	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated the Yahoo::USA source to finance.yahoo.com as
	  the quote.yahoo.com may become depreciated in the future.
	  Thanks to Iain Lea for spotting this.


2000-11-29	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated the URL we obtain currency information to
	  http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/m5?"

	* Updated docs in Yahoo/Europe.pm to note the Xtera exchange
	  moving from FX to DE.

	* Thanks to Jan Willamowius for the above two changes.


2000-11-21	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Extra code to ensure that currency-fields returned by a
	  Quotelet are unique.  This prevents the potential bug of
	  a field undergoing currency conversion multiple times and
	  hence being quite off-track.


2000-11-05	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* BUG 121557: Fixed bug where the 40th symbol in a Yahoo lookup
	  would fail.

	* Updated the FAQ.

	* Added MANIFEST file.

	* CVSTAG: finance_quote_1_04


2000-10-29	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* F::Q now makes use of a custom F::Q::UserAgent to fetch
	  information.  This is capable of doing proxy authentication
	  and other arbitary http-headers.


2000-10-27	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated yahoo_europe test suite as one of the symbols we were
	  using for testing has since dissapeared.  (Bankrupt? Merged?)


2000-10-20	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Much better discovery of non-existant stocks in ASX.pm.

	* Checks for possible divide-by-zero problems in ASX.pm.
	  Thanks to Stephen Stebbing for catching this.

	* Updated ASX testing.

	* Updated all test scripts to remove spurious warnings under
	  Perl 5.6.

	* Updated ASX module to deal with stocks when they have market
	  announcements.  Previously this would result in garbage being
	  returned for that stock.

	* Updated VWD module so it can parse information from the new
	  VWD site.

	* Updated F::Q version to 1.03.

	* CVSTAG: finance_quote_1_03

	* Mention of Bill Bell's java library in the FAQ.


2000-09-04	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>

	  bogus-looking label values.


2000-08-31	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Added Keith Refson's Trustnet module.

	* Added .cvsignore file to reduce spam for developers using CVS.

	* Updated Yahoo/USA.pm to provide more compatible returns when
	  called as a fidelity failover.

	* Tweaked DWS.t testing script so that it loads the module
	  correctly.


2000-08-29	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Rejiggered ASX module to try and make it work again after
	  an ASX site rewrite.

	* Updated Quote.pm so that if a method was called directly
	  (old-style) not through fetch, then it would do the right
	  thing if called via an object.  This means that things
	  like $q->asx(@stocks) work correctly again.

	* Updated fetch() method so that it returns the empty list
	  rather than undef when called in an array context.

	  Volker Stuerzl.  This module fetches information from the
	  Deutsche Bank Gruppe.

	* Updated asx.t script because it really hurts the entire
	  "make test" thing when ASX is unhappy.  Now it still hurts
	  (because the ASX module sucks), but less.
