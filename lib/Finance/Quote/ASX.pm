=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::ASX	- Obtain quotes from the Australian Stock Exchange.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;

    $q = Finance::Quote->new;

    %stockinfo = $q->fetch("asx","BHP");	   # Only query ASX.
    %stockinfo = $q->fetch("australia","BHP"); # Failover to other sources OK.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module obtains information from the Australian Stock Exchange
http://www.asx.com.au/.  All Australian stocks and indicies are
available.  Indexes start with the letter 'X'.  For example, the
All Ordinaries is "XAO".

This module is loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object.  It's
also possible to load it explicity by placing "ASX" in the argument
list to Finance::Quote->new().

This module provides both the "asx" and "australia" fetch methods.
Please use the "australia" fetch method if you wish to have failover
with other sources for Australian stocks (such as Yahoo).  Using
the "asx" method will guarantee that your information only comes
from the Australian Stock Exchange.

Information returned by this module is governed by the Australian
Stock Exchange's terms and conditions.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

The following labels may be returned by Finance::Quote::ASX:
date, bid, ask, open, high, low, last, close, p_change, volume,
net and price.
