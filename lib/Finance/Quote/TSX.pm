=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::TSX	- Obtain quotes from the Toronto Stock Exchange.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;

    $q = Finance::Quote->new;

    %stockinfo = $q->fetch("tsx","NT-T");	  # Only query TSX.
    %stockinfo = $q->fetch("canada","NT");  # Failover to other sources OK.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module obtains information from the Toronto Stock Exchange
through the page http://www.TMXmoney.com/.

This module is not loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object.
It's possible to load it explicity by placing "TSX" in the argument
list to Finance::Quote->new().

This module provides both the "tsx" and "toronto" fetch methods.
Please use the "canada" fetch method if you wish to have failover with other
sources for Canadian stocks.  Using the "tsx" method will guarantee that your
information only comes from the Toronto Stock Exchange.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

The following labels are returned by Finance::Quote::TSX:
name, last, net, p_change, volume and exchange.

This module returns less information (labels) than other sources but it's able
to retrieve them faster because each HTTP request performed can return up to 10
stocks. Thus, if the labels provided by this module are sufficient for your
application then you should give it a try.
