=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates::OpenExchange - Obtain currency rates from
https://openexchangerates.org

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;
    
    $q = Finance::Quote->new(currency_rates => {order        => ['OpenExchange'],
                                                openexchange => {API_KEY => ...}});

    $value = $q->currency('18.99 EUR', 'USD');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module fetches currency rates from https://openexchangerates.org and
provides data to Finance::Quote to convert the first argument to the equivalent
value in the currency indicated by the second argument.

This module caches the currency rates for the lifetime of the quoter object,
unless 'cache => 0' is included in the 'openexchange' options hash.

=head1 API_KEY

https://openexchangerates.org requires users to register and obtain an API key.  

The API key must be set by providing a 'openexchange' hash inside the
'currency_rates' hash to Finance::Quote->new as in the above example.

=head1 Terms & Conditions

Use of https://openexchangerates.org is governed by any terms & conditions of
that site.

Finance::Quote is released under the GNU General Public License, version 2,
which explicitly carries a "No Warranty" clause.
