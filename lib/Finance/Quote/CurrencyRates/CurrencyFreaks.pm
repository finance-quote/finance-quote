=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates::CurrencyFreaks - Obtain currency rates from
CurrencyFreaks.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;
    $q = Finance::Quote->new(currency_rates =>
        {order => ['CurrencyFreaks'], currencyfreaks => {API_KEY => ...} } );
    $value = $q->currency('18.99 EUR', 'USD');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module fetches currency rates from https://currencyfreaks.com/ provides 
data to Finance::Quote to convert the first argument to the equivalent value 
in the currency indicated by the second argument.

This module is not the default currency conversion module for a Finance::Quote
object. 

=head1 API_KEY

https://currencyfreaks.com/ requires users to register and obtain an API key,
which is also called a token.

The API key may be set by either providing a currencyfreaks hash inside the
currency_rates hash to Finance::Quote->new as in the above example, or by
setting the environment variable CURRENCYFREAKS_API_KEY.

=head1 Terms & Conditions

Use of https://currencyfreaks.com/ is governed by any terms & conditions of that 
site.

Finance::Quote is released under the GNU General Public License, version 2,
which explicitly carries a "No Warranty" clause.
