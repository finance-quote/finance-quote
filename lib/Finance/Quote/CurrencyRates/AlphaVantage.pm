=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates::AlphaVantage - Obtain currency rates from
https://www.alphavantage.co

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;
    
    $q = Finance::Quote->new(currency_rates => {order        => ['AlphaVantage'],
                                                alphavantage => {API_KEY => ...}});

    $value = $q->currency('18.99 EUR', 'USD');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module fetches currency rates from https://www.alphavantage.co and
provides data to Finance::Quote to convert the first argument to the equivalent
value in the currency indicated by the second argument.

This module is the default currency conversion module for a Finance::Quote
object. 

=head1 API_KEY

https://www.alphavantage.co requires users to register and obtain an API key,
which is also called a token.  

The API key may be set by either providing a alphavantage hash inside the
currency_rates hash to Finance::Quote->new as in the above example, or by
setting the environment variable ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY.

=head1 Terms & Conditions

Use of https://www.alphavantage.co is governed by any terms & conditions of
that site.

Finance::Quote is released under the GNU General Public License, version 2,
which explicitly carries a "No Warranty" clause.
