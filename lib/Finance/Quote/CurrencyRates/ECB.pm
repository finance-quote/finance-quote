=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates::ECB - Obtain currency rates from
https://www.ecb.europa.eu

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;
    
    $q = Finance::Quote->new(currency_rates => {order => ['ECB']});

    $value = $q->currency('18.99 EUR', 'CAD');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module fetches currency rates from https://www.ecb.europa.eu and
provides data to Finance::Quote to convert the first argument to the equivalent
value in the currency indicated by the second argument.

The European Central Bank provides a small list of currencies, quoted
against the Euro. This module caches the table of rates for the lifetime
of the Finance::Quote object after the first currency conversion.

=head1 Terms & Conditions

Use of https://www.ecb.europa.eu is governed by any terms & conditions of that
site.

Finance::Quote is released under the GNU General Public License, version 2,
which explicitly carries a "No Warranty" clause.
