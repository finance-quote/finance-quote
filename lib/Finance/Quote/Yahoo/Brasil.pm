=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Brasil - Fetch Brasiln stock quotes via Yahoo.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new;

    my %info = $q->fetch("yahoo_brasil","BHP"); # Use this module only.
    my %info = $q->fetch("brasil","BHP"); # Failover with other methods.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows information to be fetched from Yahoo abouts stocks
traded on the Brasilian Stock Exchange.

This module is loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object, although
it can be explicitly loaded by passing the argument "Yahoo::Brasil"
to Finance::Quote->new().

This module provides both the "brasil" and "yahoo_brasil" fetch
methods.  You should use the "brasil" method if you wish to allow
failovers to other sources, and "yahoo_brasil" if you only want
to obtain quotes from this module.

Information obtained via this module is governed by Yahoo's terms
and conditions, see http://br.finance.yahoo.com/ for more details.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

This module returns all the standard labels (where available)
provided by Yahoo, as well as the currency label.  See
Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Base for more information.
