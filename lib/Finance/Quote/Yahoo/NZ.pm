=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::Yahoo::NZ - Fetch nzn stock quotes via Yahoo.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new;

    my %info = $q->fetch("yahoo_nz","DPC"); # Use this module only.
    my %info = $q->fetch("nz","DPC"); # Failover with other methods.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows information to be fetched from Yahoo about stocks
traded on the New Zealand Stock Exchange.  Information about indexes
is not available through this module.

This module is loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object, although
it can be explicitly loaded by passing the argument "Yahoo::nz"
to Finance::Quote->new().

This module provides only the "yahoo_nz" fetch
methods. The author (stephen@vital.org.nz) will write a module to access
the NZX site if asked nicely.

Information obtained via this module is governed by Yahoo's terms
and conditions, see http://au.finance.yahoo.com/ for more details.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

This module returns all the standard labels (where available)
provided by Yahoo, as well as the currency label.  See
Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Base for more information.
