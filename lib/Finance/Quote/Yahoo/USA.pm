=head1 DESCRIPTION

This method provides access to financial information from a number
of exhcanges in the United States and Canada.  The following methods
are available:

	canada
	usa
	yahoo
	nyse
	nasdaq
	vanguard
	fidelity
	tiaacref

These methods all use the same information source, and hence can
be considered somewhat interchangable.  However, the method "yahoo"
should be passed to fetch if you wish to obtain information
from any source that Yahoo tracks.

This method is loaded by default by Finance::Quote, although it
can be explicitly loaded by passing the argument "Yahoo::USA"
to Finance::Quote->new().

Information returned by this module may be subject to Yahoo's
terms and conditions.  See http://finance.yahoo.com/ for more
information.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

This module returns all the standard labels that Yahoo provides,
as well as the currency label.  See Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Base
for more information.

=head1 BUGS

Yahoo does not make a distinction between the various exchanges
in the United States and Canada.  For example, it is possible to request
a stock using the "NYSE" method and still obtain data even if that stock
does not exist on the NYSE but exists on a different exchange.
