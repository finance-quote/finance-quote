Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Europe - Fetch quotes from Yahoo Europe

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;
    $q = Finance::Quote->new;

    %info = $q->fetch("europe","12150.PA"); # Failover to other methods ok.
    %info = $q->fetch("yahoo_europe","12150.PA"); # Use this module only.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module fetches information from Yahoo Europe.  Symbols should be
provided in the format "SYMBOL.EXCHANGE", where the exchange code is
one of the following:

	PA - Paris
	BC - Barcelona
	BE - Berlin
	BI - Bilbao
	BR - Breme
	CO - Copenhagen
	D  - Dusseldorf
	F  - Frankfurt
	H  - Hamburg
	HA - Hanover
	L  - London
	MA - Madrid
	MC - Madrid (M.C.)
	MI - Milan
	MU - Munich
	O  - Oslo
	ST - Stockholm
	SG - Stuttgart
	VA - Valence
	VI - Vienna
	DE - Xetra (was FX)

This module provides both the "europe" and "yahoo_europe" methods.
The "europe" method should be used if failover methods are desirable.
The "yahoo_europe" method should be used you desire to only fetch
information from Yahoo Europe.

This module is loaded by default by Finance::Quote, but can be loaded
explicitly by specifying the parameter "Yahoo::Europe" to
Finance::Quote->new().

Information obtained by this module may be covered by Yahoo's terms
and conditions.  See http://finance.uk.yahoo.com/ for more details.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

This module returns all the standard labels (where available) provided
by Yahoo.  See Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Base for a list of these.  The
currency label is also returned.

Note however that div_date and ex_div have been removed by yahoo
europe site
