=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Base - Common functions for fetching Yahoo info.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Base functions for use by the Finance::Quote::Yahoo::* modules.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is not called directly, rather it provides a set of
base functions which other Yahoo-related modules can use.  If you're
thinking of writing a module to fetch specific information from
Yahoo, then you might wish to look through the source code for
this module.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

Most Yahoo functions will return a standard set of labels.  These
include (where available): symbol, name, last, date, time, net,
p_change, volume, bid, ask close, open, day_range, year_range, eps,
pe, div_date, div, div_yield, cap, ex_div, avg_vol.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Australia, Finance::Quote::Yahoo::USA,
Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Europe.
