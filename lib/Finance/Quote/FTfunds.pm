=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::FTfunds - Obtain UK Unit Trust quotes from FT.com (Financial Times).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $q = Finance::Quote->new;

    %info = Finance::Quote->fetch("ftfunds","<isin> ...");  # Only query FT.com using ISINs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module fetches information from the Financial Times Funds service,
http://funds.ft.com. There are over 47,000 UK Unit Trusts and OEICs quoted,
as well as many Offshore Funds and Exhange Traded Funds (ETFs). It converts
any funds quoted in GBX (pence) to GBP, dividing the price by 100 in the
process.

Funds are identified by their ISIN code, a 12 character alphanumeric code.
Although the web site also allows searching by fund name, this version of
Finance::Quote::FTfunds only implements ISIN lookup. To determine the ISIN for
funds of interest to you, visit the funds.ft.com site and use the flexible search
facilities to identify the funds of interest. The factsheet display for any given
fund displays the ISIN along with other useful information.

This module is loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object. It's
also possible to load it explicitly by placing "ftfunds" in the argument
list to Finance::Quote->new().

Information obtained by this module may be covered by funds.ft.com
terms and conditions See http://funds.ft.com/ and http://ft.com for details.

=head2 Stocks And Indices

This module provides both the "ftfunds" and "ukfunds" fetch methods for
fetching UK and Offshore Unit Trusts and OEICs prices and other information
from funds.ft.com. Please use the "ukfunds" fetch method if you wish to have
failover with future sources for UK and Offshore Unit Trusts and OEICs - the
author has plans to develop Finance::Quote modules for the London Stock Exchange
and Morningstar unit trust services. Using the "ftfunds" method will guarantee
that your information only comes from the funds.ft.com website.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

The following labels may be returned by Finance::Quote::ftfunds :

    name, currency, last, date, time, price, nav, source, method,
    iso_date, net, p_change, success, errormsg.
