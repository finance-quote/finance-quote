=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::HEX	- Obtain quotes from the Helsinki Stock Exchange.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;

    $q = Finance::Quote->new;

    %stockinfo = $q->fetch("hex","NOK1V");	   # Only query ASX.
    %stockinfo = $q->fetch("finland","NOK1V"); # Failover to other sources OK.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module obtains information from the Helsinki Stock Exchange
http://www.hex.com/.  All Finnish stocks are available.

This module is not loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object.
It's possible to load it explicity by placing "HEX" in the argument
list to Finance::Quote->new().

This module provides both the "hex" and "finland" fetch methods.
Please use the "finland" fetch method if you wish to have failover
with other sources for Finnish stocks.  Using the "hex" method will
guarantee that your information only comes from the Helsinki Stock
Exchange.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

The following labels may be returned by Finance::Quote::HEX:
name, last, high, low, date, time, p_change, volume, bid, ask,
price, method and exchange.

=head1 SEE ALSO
