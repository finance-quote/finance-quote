=head1 NAME

Finance::Quote::MorningstarUK - Obtain UK Unit Trust quotes from morningstar.co.uk.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $q = Finance::Quote->new;

    %info = $q->fetch("mstaruk","<isin> ...");  # Only query morningstar.co.uk using ISINs
    %info = $q->fetch("ukfunds","<isin> ...");  # Failover to other sources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module fetches information from the MorningStar Funds service,
http://morningstar.com/uk/. There are many UK Unit Trusts and OEICs quoted,
as well as many Offshore Funds and Exhange Traded Funds (ETFs). It converts
any funds quoted in GBX (pence) to GBP, dividing the price by 100 in the
process.

Funds are identified by their ISIN code.

This module is loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object. It's
also possible to load it explicitly by placing "mstaruk" in the argument
list to Finance::Quote->new().

Information obtained by this module may be covered by funds.ft.com
terms and conditions See http://morningstar.co.ukfor details.

=head2 Stocks And Indices

This module provides both the "mstaruk" and "ukfunds" fetch methods for
fetching UK and Offshore Unit Trusts and OEICs prices and other information
from funds.ft.com. Please use the "ukfunds" fetch method if you wish to have
failover with future sources for UK and Offshore Unit Trusts and OEICs - the
author has plans to develop Finance::Quote modules for other source providing
unit trust prices. Using the "mstaruk" method will guarantee
that your information only comes from the morningstar.co.uk website.

=head1 LABELS RETURNED

The following labels may be returned by Finance::Quote::MorningstarUK :

    name, currency, last, date, time, price, nav, source, method,
    iso_date, net, p_change, success, errormsg.
