2000-07-15	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>

2000-08-14	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated chkshares script so that it can deal with any market,
	  not just the ASX.

2000-08-16	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Added DWS.pm module to the CVS repository, courtesy of
	  Volker Stuerzl.  This module fetches information from the
	  Deutsche Bank Gruppe.

	* Updated asx.t script because it really hurts the entire
	  "make test" thing when ASX is unhappy.  Now it still hurts
	  (because the ASX module sucks), but less.

2000-08-21	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Improved documentation in the yahoo_europe test script.

	* Rejiggered ASX module to try and make it work again after
	  an ASX site rewrite.

	* Updated Quote.pm so that if a method was called directly
	  (old-style) not through fetch, then it would do the right
	  thing if called via an object.  This means that things
	  like $q->asx(@stocks) work correctly again.

	* Updated fetch() method so that it returns the empty list
	  rather than undef when called in an array context.

	* fetch() now returns a hashref if called in a scalar context.

2000-08-31	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Added Keith Refson's Trustnet module.

	* Added .cvsignore file to reduce spam for developers using CVS.

	* Updated Yahoo/USA.pm to provide more compatible returns when

	  correctly.

2000-09-01	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Tweaked ASX.pm to avoid divide-by-zero errors and dodgy
	  bogus-looking label values.

2000-09-04	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Keith Refson's patch to Trustnet to avoid premature returns
	  in case of a bad symbol.

2000-09-12	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>

	* Checks for possible divide-by-zero problems in ASX.pm.
	  Thanks to Stephen Stebbing for catching this.

	* Updated ASX testing.

	* Updated all test scripts to remove spurious warnings under
	  Perl 5.6.

	* Updated ASX module to deal with stocks when they have market
	  announcements.  Previously this would result in garbage being
	  returned for that stock.

	* Updated VWD module so it can parse information from the new
	  VWD site.

	* Updated F::Q version to 1.03.

	* CVSTAG: finance_quote_1_03

2000-10-27	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated yahoo_europe test suite as one of the symbols we were
	  using for testing has since dissapeared.  (Bankrupt? Merged?)

2000-10-29	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* F::Q now makes use of a custom F::Q::UserAgent to fetch
	  information.  This is capable of doing proxy authentication
	  and other arbitary http-headers.

2000-11-05	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* BUG 121557: Fixed bug where the 40th symbol in a Yahoo lookup
	  would fail.

	* F::Q::UserAgent is now ready for release, but is still considered
	  experimental.  Users must explicitly turn it on by setting
	  $Finance::Quote::USE_EXPERIMENTAL_UA = 1;

	* Updated the FAQ.

	* Added MANIFEST file.

	* CVSTAG: finance_quote_1_04

2000-11-21	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Extra code to ensure that currency-fields returned by a
	  Quotelet are unique.  This prevents the potential bug of
	  a field undergoing currency conversion multiple times and
	  hence being quite off-track.

2000-11-29	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated the URL we obtain currency information to
	  http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/m5?"

	* Updated docs in Yahoo/Europe.pm to note the Xtera exchange
	  moving from FX to DE.

	* Thanks to Jan Willamowius for the above two changes.

	* Updated the Yahoo::USA source to finance.yahoo.com as
	  the quote.yahoo.com may become depreciated in the future.
	  Thanks to Iain Lea for spotting this.

2001-01-22	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated to respect the FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET environment variable
	  to auto-load custom Quotelet.

2001-02-16	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>

	  currency function.

	  FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET

2001-04-05	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated ASX.pm module to reflect changed location of
	  information on the ASX's website.  (Still doesn't
	  help when the ASX site is totally broken, as is
	  too often the case.)

	* Updated Trustnet.pm module to reflect changes to the
	  Trustnet site.

2001-05-08	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Applied Leigh Wedding's patch to ASX.pm, after ASX changed
	  their website yet again!  All is working happily once
	  more. Thanks Leigh.

	* Added Tobias Vancura's F::Q::Fool module.

	* Added Fool as a automatically loaded loaded module from
	  F::Quote.pm.

2001-05-09	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Fixed strange behaviour which could occur when using
	  FQ_LOAD_QUOTELET environment variable.  This now works
	  as intened.

	* Added Jasmin Bertovic's Cdnfundlibrary module.

2001-05-10	Volker Stuerzl
	* Updated VWD.pm to account for changes in VWD website.

	  remove asterisks from names.

2001-06-04	Brent Neal	<brentn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed Tiaacref.pm to reflect new CGIs at www.tiaa-cref.org

	  documentation for more info. 

2001-06-25	Linas Vepstas
	* Added Tdwaterhouse module from James A. Treacy.

2001-06-26	Paul Fenwick <pjf@cpan.org>
	* Added AEX module courtesy of Rob Sessink.

	* Updated ASX module to use the new (again!) ASX website.

	  simplier now.

	* Updated the Fidelity test to always test the fidelity_direct method.

	* Bumped version number on F::Q to 1.06.

	* Updated Trustnet module to assume GBP if no currency explicitly
	  shown.

	* Updated Trustnet test because one of the funds we were looking
	  for had changed its name, causing the test to fail.

	* Added AEX test suite to repository.

	* Removed failover into Fool.pm support, as I'd like to do more
	  testing before it enters the failover system.

	* Updated the FAQ.

	* Updated the INSTALL file.

	* Moved regression tests from /t to /test. Updated MANIFEST
	  file accordingly.  This means that autoamtic installs from
	  CPAN won't run the regression tests, which was causing
	  installation to fail on some systems.

	* Updated lists of copyright holders, SEE ALSO sections
	  in man-pages.

	* CVSTAG: finance_quote_1_06

2001-07-04	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Confirmed debian packages release with Ross Peachey.

	* Moved cvs tags in debian/* so that finance_quote_1_06
	  point to the files used in building 1.06, not those building
	  1.05.

2001-07-23	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Updated Yahoo::Europe.pm so that stocks fetched from the
	  Stockholm exhcnage (.ST) are correctly listed as being in
	  Swedish Krona (SEK).

2001-12-19	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Added Finance::Quote::Yahoo::Asia to provide lookup of
	  Asian stock quotes (not including Japan).  Many thanks
	  to M.R.Muthu Kumar for this patch.

2002-04-18	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Patched Quote.pm after currency conversion started to fail.

	  (#666349)

2003-07-04	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Fixed currency conversion problems. (#232075)

	* Fixed ASX problems whereby quotes were not being obtained.
	  Thanks to Rik Harris for bringing this issue to light,
	  and providing a correct URL.  (#653025)

	* Fixed problem where no symbol tag was being defined in ASX.
	  Thanks again to Rik Harris.  (#653035)

	* Fixed problem where undefined currencies would be returned
	  as zero, and not undefined as occured in previous versions.

	* Fixed tests in currency.t which assumed that conversion
	  could be done between EUR and former European currencies.
	  These are no longer supported due to a change in the
	  lookups provided by Yahoo.

	* Updated Fidelity.pm to indicate its current non-working status.

	* Added T. Rowe Price patches by David Hampton, which provide
	  a troweprice_direct method.  (#666351)

	* As above, for the Fidelity module.  (#666353)

	* Accepted David Hampton's patch to Yahoo currencies.
	  The correct currency will now be flagged on stocks regardless
	  of the module used to grab them. (#666361)

	* Added Keith Refson's module to obtain quotes from
	  First Trust Portfolios L.P.  Thanks to David Hampton
	  (again!) for supplying this. (#670202)

	* Added Ganesan Rajagopal's excellent IndiaMutal module.
	  (#720896)

	* Fixed Cdnfundlibrary to correctly set the success flag
	  when successful.  Thanks to Robert Clark for finding
	  this bug.  (#752395)

	* Updated Tdwaterhouse.pm with Robert Clark's changes to
	  work with the new TD Waterhouse website.  Many thanks
	  to Robert Clark again. (#750843)

	  Clark, including test cases.  (#752423).

	  handling, screening out of high-ascii characters from
	  fields, and removal of spurious debug output.

	* CVSTAG: finance_quote_1_08

2003-07-06	Pawel Konieczny	<konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Update of F::Q::AEX module: added a remap functionality 
	  which translates the official stock ticker to AEX CGI 
	  symbol

	* Update of F::Q::AEX module: Distiguishing indices and stocks:
	  indices will have "currency" label undefined, stocks will have
	  value "EUR".  This fixes the currency conversion problem for
	  indices.

	* Update of F::Q::AEX module: Cleanup of labels: "offer" renamed to
	  "ask" ("ask" is more common, besides, it can be
	  currency-converted). Label "offer" stays for backward
	  compatibility.

	* Update of F::Q::AEX module: Cleanup of garbage in some fields.
	  (Ocassionally, the http fetch & parse will return garbage for
	  some values).

2003-07-07	Pawel Konieczny	<konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>
	* AEX module: added label 'symbol'

2003-08-27	Pawel Konieczny	<konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>

	'undef' is returned if no valid data could be dowloaded
	(previously it was returning empty strings in such cases).

2003-08-31	Pawel Konieczny <konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>
	* AEX module: major update: fetching of stock and index options
	implemented.  POD and test script updated as well.

2003-08-31  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* Yahoo/Base.pm: Added entry for the Lisbon Portugal stock
	exchange.

2003-09-12  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* Yahoo/Base.pm: Added suffixes for 1) the US Options, 2) US
	exchanges when using a non-US Yahoo site, and 3) the Zurich
	exchange.

2003-09-15	Pawel Konieczny <konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>
	* AEX module: major update: additional labels for options available:
	volume, oi, and other. Subframes cache implemented, resulting in 
	substantial speedup for repeating (intraday) requests of individual 
	options.

2003-09-20	Pawel Konieczny <konieczp@users.sourceforge.net>
