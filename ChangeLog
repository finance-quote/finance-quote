	  not just the ASX.

2000-08-16	Paul Fenwick	<pjf@cpan.org>
	* Added DWS.pm module to the CVS repository, courtesy of
	  Volker Stuerzl.  This module fetches information from the
	  Deutsche Bank Gruppe.

	* Updated asx.t script because it really hurts the entire
	  "make test" thing when ASX is unhappy.  Now it still hurts
	  (because the ASX module sucks), but less.

	* Rejiggered ASX module to try and make it work again after
	  an ASX site rewrite.

	* Updated Quote.pm so that if a method was called directly
	  (old-style) not through fetch, then it would do the right
	  thing if called via an object.  This means that things
	  like $q->asx(@stocks) work correctly again.

	* Updated fetch() method so that it returns the empty list
	  rather than undef when called in an array context.

	* fetch() now returns a hashref if called in a scalar context.

	  correctly.

	  bogus-looking label values.

	  in case of a bad symbol.

	  modules that F::Q depends upon.
