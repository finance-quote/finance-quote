This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of Finance::Quote.  This
is a set of perl modules which provide access to securities prices.

This package was put together by Ross Peachey <rcp@debian.org>, from
the original sources, available from:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/finance-quote/

The library is also available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network (CPAN). Visit <URL:http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN
site near you.

The only change for the Debian package was the addition of the debian/
files.

Finance::Quote is released under the GNU Public Licence, which can be found in
/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL on Debian systems.
