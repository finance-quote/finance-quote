Finance::Quote 
==============

IMPORTANT
=========

Read Documentation/License for the license (GPL) covering this code.

Dependancies
------------
Finance::Quote depends upon a number of other perl modules to
function correctly.  These modules include:

	LWP::UserAgent
	HTTP::Request::Common
	HTML::TableExtract

You will receive a warning during the make process if one or more of
these modules are missing.

One easy way to install the modules that Finance::Quote requires is
to use perl's CPAN module:

	hostname$ perl -MCPAN -e shell (as root)

If you haven't used the CPAN module before, then it may ask you a few
simple configuration questions before you get to the cpan> prompt.
You can install any module from CPAN using:

	cpan> install my::module

Indeed, it's possible to install Finance::Quote and all the modules
it depends upon using:

	cpan> install Finance::Quote

Install instructions
--------------------

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
# make install		(as root)

Couldn't be easier, could it?

Running the Regression Tests
----------------------------
By default, Finance::Quote does not run its regression tests for
an automatic install.  This is because the tests rely upon a working
Internet connection, and for third-party websites to be operating
correctly, which is not always the case.

If you wish to run the regression tests, then unpack the module as
per normal, but instead use the following steps:

$ ln -s test t
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
# make install		(as root)

The tests do take some time to run, so please be patient.

Note, there are two modules that are known to currency require
maintenance, so expect the asx.t and trustnet.t tests to fail.

What if my tests fail?
----------------------
Your tests could fail if your machine does not have a connection to the
Internet, if your machine must use an HTTP proxy and you do not have
your http_proxy environment variable set, or if one or more of the
servers that Finance::Quote uses is down or unhappy.

The tests can also fail if you have not installed all the modules
that Finance::Quote depends upon.  See the section on dependancies
above.
