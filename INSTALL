Finance::Quote 
==============

IMPORTANT
=========

Read Documentation/License for the license (GPL) covering this code.

Install instructions
--------------------

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test		(optional)
# make install		(as root)

Couldn't be easier, could it?

The tests do take some time to run (especially the currency test), so
please be patient.

What if my tests fail?
----------------------
Your tests could fail if your machine does not have a connection to the
Internet, if your machine must use an HTTP proxy and you do not have
your http_proxy environment variable set, or if one or more of the
servers that Finance::Quote uses is down or unhappy.

The tests can also fail if you do not have LWP installed, which
Finance::Quote depends.

If you believe you've found a bug, please contact Paul Fenwick
<pjf@cpan.org>.
