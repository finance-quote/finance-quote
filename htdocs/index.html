An article on Finance::Quote was featured in The Perl Journal,
issue number 19. The article is a good introduction to the module and
well worth reading if you are beginning to work with Finance::Quote.<br>
Sadly, The Perl Journal is no longer published. Thanks to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/">The Web Archive</a>, you can find the issue
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021008080834/http://www.sysadminmag.com/tpj/issues/vol5_3/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
O'Reilly also publishes <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/950" target="_blank">The Best of the Perl Journal</a>.
