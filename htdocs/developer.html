      <h2 class="new" align="center">Important note</h2>
        <p class="new">After the release 1.13 we took two important
           decisions :</p>
        <p class="new"><li class="new">Current evolution of
           development tools made us port the repository to Git</li>
        <li class="new">Since Finance::Quote releases are available
            through <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a> we also
            decided to make full use of the tools available on the
            Cpan platform.</li></p>
        <p class="new">Please note that we are in the early stages of
           the implementation of these changes. Some of the work has
           already been done, but some data has still to be ported or
           disgarded. Please take a look at this page for further
           evolution. Reports will also be posted to the developers
           mailing-list. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience
           these changes may cause.</p>

      <h2 align="center">Bug-tracking</h2>
	<p>Bugs can be submitted and tracked via Cpan's RT
	   <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Status=Active&Name=Finance-Quote">
	   bug-tracking system</a>.  Before submitting a bug, please
	   make sure that someone else has not submitted the bug
	   already.</p>
        <p>Bugs posted on the Sourceforge's
           <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=4232">bug tracking system</a>
           after 1.7.2007 are ported to RT. Older bug reports (prior
           to release 1.13) will certainly be disgarded. Don't use the
           Sourceforge's BTS for new bug reports as those won't be checked.</p>

      <h2 align="center">Patches</h2>
        <p>Patches must be submitted as file attachments to bug
           reports (see above).</p>
        <p>Patches submitted on Sourceforge's site after 1.7.2007 will
           eventually be lookad at. Older patches will certainly be disgarded.</p>
	<p>For reference, we'll mention the link to the SourceForge's
	   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=4232">
	   patch manager.</a> Don't use it for new patches as those won't
           be checked.</p>
        <p>Before submitting a patch please make
	   sure that you have the most up-to-date version of
	   Finance::Quote, and that nobody has submitted an equivalent
	   patch already.</p>

      <h2 align="center">Mailing-lists</h2>
	<p>A developer's mailing list exists for those people who are
	   using or developing Finance::Quote.  For more information,
	   see our <a href="discussion.html">Discussion Groups and
	   Mailing Lists page</a>.</p>

     <h2 align="center">Git</h2>
        <p>Anonymous access to the development branch is available
           for those wishing to use the development branch of Finance::Quote.
           Details on anonymous Git access can be found
           <a href="http://github.com/finance-quote/finance-quote">here</a>.</p>

     <h2 align="center">CVS</h2>
	<p>The development repository has been ported to Git.
           Please note that while CVS is still available, updates
           starting at version 1.13 won't be sent to the CVS repository.</p>
	<p>Details on anonymous CVS access can be found
           <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=4232">here</a>.</p>

     <h2 align="center">Hacker's Guide</h2>
	<p>The Hacker's Guide contains information on how to extend
	   Finance::Quote to make use of your own custom information
	   sources.  The most recent version of the Hacker's Guide
	   can be found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=158&group_id=4232">here</a>.</p>
