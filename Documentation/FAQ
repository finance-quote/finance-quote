1. Where is the Finance::Quote webpage?
=======================================
	http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/

2. Where can I get a beginner's introduction to F::Q?
=====================================================
	A good beginner's guide is the Finance::Quote article in
	The Perl Journal (http://www.tpj.com/) edition #19.  If you
	don't have a subscription to TPJ, you can also read the
	final draft of this essay at
	<http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/documentation.html>.

3. How can I use proxyauth (experimental)?
==========================================
	WARNING: THIS SUPPORT IS EXPERIMENTAL AND SYNTAX _WILL_ CHANGE IN
	         THE FUTURE.  If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

	Finance::Quote provides experimental support for authenticated
	proxies.  If you wish to try this, then put the following at the
	top of your script.

		use Finance::Quote;
		$Finance::Quote::USE_EXPERIMENTAL_UA = 1;

	This adds extra features on top of the regular LWP::UserAgent
	class.  In particular, you can now do things like this:

	my $q = Finance::Quote->new();
	$q->user_agent->default_headers->proxy_authorization_basic($user,$pass);

	The result of $q->user_agent->default_headers is a HTTP::Headers
	object, and can use all the regular HTTP::Headers methods.
	This object is used as a template for any new HTTP requests made by
	Finance::Quote.

4. Is there anything similar to F::Q in other programming languages?
====================================================================
	Vidyut Luther has written a stock-lookup library in PHP.  It's
	available at <http://www.gotslack.com/stocks/>

	Bill Bell has written a stock-lookup library in Java.  It's
	available at <http://www.aboutbillbell.com/>.  Follow the
	"Code Downloads" link in the left sidebar.

5. Where can I get more help?
=============================
	If you haven't already done so, try the Finance::Quote webpage
	at <http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/>.  There are also lots
	of fun things like bug-tracking systems, support requests, forums,
	and other goodies at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/finance-quote/>.

	Finally, you can always try sending mail to the Finance::Quote
	developer's list, at <finance-quote-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.
	The archives of this list are available on-line at
	<http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=4232>.
