Welcome to Finance::Quote
=========================
Maintained by: Paul Fenwick <pjf@cpan.org>

This project is currently under development, and currently only contains
a few files.  Those files are:

lib/Finance/Quote.pm		- The Quote fetching module.
Examples/Quote_example.pl	- A script which demonstrates the features of
				  Finance::Quote.
Examples/chkshares.pl		- A script which can be used to fetch ASX
				  share prices quickly.

The repository will shortly contain better documentation, installation
scripts, and more examples.

Try running `perldoc' over lib/Finance/Quote.pm for more information on
how to use the library, or `perldoc Finance::Quote' once things have been
installed.
