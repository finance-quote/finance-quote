TODO list.  This is an un-ordered list of things that would be good
in Finance::Quote.

* Automatic currency conversion.  Eg:

	$quoter->currency("AUD");
	$quoter->fetch("nyse","IBM");

  and get back the information in Australian dollars (AUD).  I (pjf)
  have some code which partially does this.

* More regression testing.  Particularly of loadable module support.

* Better documentation.  Each sub-module should contain information
  specific to that module (eg, fields returned, etc).

* Yahoo::USA and Yahoo::Europe inheriting off a common base (good
  code provided by Xose to do this).

* Fixes for some modules which might make use of a very long GET line.
  Eg, Yahoo methods barf if more than about 50 stocks are requested
  at once.  (Patch by Peter Thatcher provided which needs to be
  installed.)

* Webpage to be made pretty (bnh).
