# NAME

Finance::Quote - Get stock and mutual fund quotes from various exchanges

# SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;

    $q = Finance::Quote->new;
    %quotes  = $q->fetch("nasdaq", @stocks);

# DESCRIPTION

This module gets stock quotes from various internet sources all over the world.
Quotes are obtained by constructing a quoter object and using the fetch method
to gather data, which is returned as a two-dimensional hash (or a reference to
such a hash, if called in a scalar context).  For example:

    $q = Finance::Quote->new;
    %info = $q->fetch("australia", "CML");
    print "The price of CML is ".$info{"CML", "price"};

The first part of the hash (eg, "CML") is referred to as the stock.
The second part (in this case, "price") is referred to as the label.

## LABELS

When information about a stock is returned, the following standard labels may
be used.  Some custom-written modules may use labels not mentioned here.  If
you wish to be certain that you obtain a certain set of labels for a given
stock, you can specify that using require\_labels().

# PUBLIC CLASS METHODS

Finance::Quote implements public class methods for constructing a quoter
object, getting or setting default class values, and for listing available
methods.

## new

    my $q = Finance::Quote->new()
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new('-defaults')
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new('AEX', 'Fool')
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new(timeout => 30)
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new('YahooJSON', fetch_currency => 'EUR')
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new('alphavantage' => {API_KEY => '...'})
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new('IEXCloud', 'iexcloud' => {API_KEY => '...'});
    my $q = Finance::Quote->new(currency_rates => {order => ['ECB', 'Fixer'], 'fixer' => {API_KEY => '...'}});

Finance::Quote modules access a wide range of sources to provide quotes.  A
module provides one or more methods to fetch quotes. One method is usually the
name of the module in lower case. Other methods, if provided, are descriptive
names, such as 'canada', 'nasdaq', or 'nyse'.

A Finance::Quote object uses one or more methods to fetch quotes for
securities. 

`new` constructs a Finance::Quote object and enables the caller to load only
specific modules, set parameters that control the behavior of the fetch method,
and pass method specific parameters.

- `timeout =` T> sets the web request timeout to `T` seconds
- `failover =` B> where `B` is a boolean value indicating if failover in
fetch is permitted
- `fetch_currency =` C> sets the desired currency code to `C` for fetch
results
- `currency_rates =` H> configures the order currency rate modules are
consulted for exchange rates and currency rate module options
- `required_labels =` A> sets the required labels for fetch results to
array `A`
- `<ModuleName`> as a string is the name of a specific
Finance::Quote::Module to load
- `<methodname` => H> passes hash `H` to methodname during fetch to 
configure the method

With no arguments, `new` creates a Finance::Quote object with the default
methods.  If the environment variable FQ\_LOAD\_QUOTELET is set, then the
contents of FQ\_LOAD\_QUOTELET (split on whitespace) will be used as the argument
list.  This allows users to load their own custom modules without having to
change existing code. If any method names are passed to `new` or the flag
'-defaults' is included in the argument list, then FQ\_LOAD\_QUOTELET is ignored.

When new() is passed one or more class name arguments, an object is created with
only the specified modules loaded.  If the first argument is '-defaults', then
the default modules will be loaded first, followed by any other specified
modules. Note that the FQ\_LOAD\_QUOTELET environment variable must begin with
'-defaults' if you wish the default modules to be loaded.

Method names correspond to the Perl module in the Finance::Quote module space.
For example, `Finance::Quote-`new('ASX')> will load the module
Finance::Quote::ASX, which provides the method "asx".

Some methods require API keys or have unique options. Passing 'method => HASH'
to new() enables the caller to provide a configuration HASH to the corresponding
method.

The key 'currency\_rates' configures the Finanace::Quote currency rate
conversion.  By default, to maintain backward compatibility,
Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates::AlphaVantage is used for currency conversion.
This end point requires an API key, which can either be set in the environment
or included in the configuration hash. To specify a different primary currency
conversion method or configure fallback methods, include the 'order' key, which
points to an array of Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates module names.
Setting the environment variable FQ\_CURRENCY will change the default 
endpoint used for currency conversion.
See the documentation for the individual Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates to
learn more. 

## get\_default\_currency\_fields

    my @fields = Finance::Quote::get_default_currency_fields();

`get_default_currency_fields` returns the standard list of fields in a quote
that are automatically converted during currency conversion. Individual modules
may override this list.

## get\_default\_timeout

    my $value = Finance::Quote::get_default_timeout();

`get_default_timeout` returns the current Finance::Quote default timeout in
seconds for web requests. Finance::Quote does not specify a default timeout,
deferring to the underlying user agent for web requests. So this function
will return undef unless `set_default_timeout` was previously called.

## set\_default\_timeout

    Finance::Quote::set_default_timeout(45);

`set_default_timeout` sets the Finance::Quote default timeout to a new value.

## get\_methods

    my @methods = Finance::Quote::get_methods();

`get_methods` returns the list of methods that can be passed to `new` when
creating a quoter object and as the first argument to `fetch`.

## get\_features

    my %features = Finance::Quote::get_features();

`get_features` returns a hash with three keys: quote\_methods, quote\_modules, and currency\_modules.

    $features{quote_methods} is a hash with key/value pairs of method_name => [array of module names]
    $features{quote_modules} is a hash with key/value pairs of module_name => [array of parameter names]
    $features{currency_modules} is a hash with key/value pairs of currency_module_name => [array of paramater names]

Parameter names are values that the module needs to function, such as API\_KEY. Most
modules will have an empty list.  Modules with a parameter are configured when creating
the Finance::Quote by passing the argument

    'module_name_in_lower_case' => {paramter => value}

to Finance::Quote->new().

The keys of the $features{currency\_modules} hash are the names of currency
modules that can be used for currency conversion and the order in which the
modules are used is controlled by the argument

    currency_rates => {order => [subset of $features{currency_modules}]} 

to Finance::Quote->new().  By default, only AlphaVantage in used for 
currency conversion, so "order" must be set to use other currency modules.

# PUBLIC OBJECT METHODS

## B\_to\_billions

    my $value = $q->B_to_billions("20B");

`B_to_billions` is a utility function that expands a numeric string with a "B"
suffix to the corresponding multiple of 1000000000.

## decimal\_shiftup

    my $value = $q->decimal_shiftup("123.45", 1);  # returns 1234.5
    my $value = $q->decimal_shiftup("0.25", 1);    # returns 2.5

`decimal_shiftup` moves a the decimal point in a numeric string the specified
number of places to the right.

## fetch

    my %stocks  = $q->fetch("alphavantage", "IBM", "MSFT", "LNUX");
    my $hashref = $q->fetch("nasdaq", "IBM", "MSFT", "LNUX");

`fetch` takes a method as its first argument and the remaining arguments are
treated as securities.  If the quoter `$q` was constructed with a specific
method or methods, then only those methods are available.

When called in an array context, a hash is returned.  In a scalar context, a
reference to a hash will be returned. The keys for the returned hash are
`{SECURITY,LABEL}`.  For the above example call, `$stocks{"IBM","high"}` is
the high value for IBM.

$q->get\_methods() returns the list of valid methods for quoter object $q. Some
methods specify a specific Finance::Quote module, such as 'alphavantage'. Other
methods are available from multiple Finance::Quote modules, such as 'nasdaq'.
The quoter failover over option determines if multiple modules are consulted
for methods such as 'nasdaq' that more than one implementation.

## get\_failover

    my $failover = $q->get_failover();

Failover is when the `fetch` method attempts to retrieve quote information for
a security from alternate sources when the requested method fails.
`get_failover` returns a boolean value indicating if the quoter object will
use failover or not.

## set\_failover

    $q->set_failover(False);

`set_failover` sets the failover flag on the quoter object. 

## get\_fetch\_currency

    my $currency = $q->get_fetch_currency();

`get_fetch_currency` returns either the desired currency code for the quoter
object or undef if no target currency was set during construction or with the
`set_fetch_currency` function.

## set\_fetch\_currency

    $q->set_fetch_currency("FRF");  # Get results in French Francs.

`set_fetch_currency` method is used to request that all information be
returned in the specified currency.  Note that this increases the chance
stock-lookup failure, as remote requests must be made to fetch both the stock
information and the currency rates.  In order to improve reliability and speed
performance, currency conversion rates are cached and are assumed not to change
for the duration of the Finance::Quote object.

See the introduction to this page for information on how to configure the
source of currency conversion rates.

## get\_required\_labels

    my @labels = $q->get_required_labels();

`get_required_labels` returns the list of labels that must be populated for a
security quote to be considered valid and returned by `fetch`.

## set\_required\_labels

    my $labels = ['close', 'isodate', 'last'];
    $q->set_required_labels($labels);

`set_required_labels` updates the list of required labels for the quoter object.

## get\_timeout

    my $timeout = $q->get_timeout();

`get_timeout` returns the timeout in seconds the quoter object is using for
web requests.

## set\_timeout

    $q->set_timeout(45);

`set_timeout` updated the timeout in seconds for the quoter object.

## store\_date

    $quoter->store_date(\%info, $stocks, {eurodate => '06/11/2020'});

`store_date` is used by modules to consistent store date information about 
securities. Given the various pieces of a date, this function figures out how to
construct a ISO date (yyyy-mm-dd) and US date (mm/dd/yyyy) and stores those
values in `%info` for security `$stock`.

## get\_user\_agent

    my $ua = $q->get_user_agent();

`get_user_agent` returns the LWP::UserAgent the quoter object is using for web
requests.

## isoTime

    $q->isoTime("11:39PM");    # returns "23:39"
    $q->isoTime("9:10 AM");    # returns "09:10"

`isoTime` returns an ISO formatted time.

# PUBLIC CLASS OR OBJECT METHODS

The following methods are available as class methods, but can also be called
from Finance::Quote objects.

## scale\_field

    my $value = Finance::Quote->scale_field('1023', '0.01')

`scale_field` is a utility function that scales the first argument by the
second argument.  In the above example, `value` is `'10.23'`.

## currency

    my $value = $q->currency('15.95 USD', 'AUD');
    my $value = Finance::Quote->currency('23.45 EUR', 'RUB');

`currency` converts a value with a currency code suffix to another currency
using the current exchange rate as determined by the
Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates method or methods configured for the quoter $q.
When called as a class method, only Finance::Quote::AlphaVantage is used, which
requires an API key. See the introduction for information on configuring
currency rate conversions and see Finance::Quote::CurrencyRates::AlphaVantage
for information about the API key.

## currency\_lookup

    my $currency = $quoter->currency_lookup();
    my $currency = $quoter->currency_lookup( name => "Caribbean");
    my $currency = $quoter->currency_loopup( country => qw/denmark/i );
    my $currency = $q->currency_lookup(country => qr/united states/i, number => 840);

`currency_lookup` takes zero or more constraints and filters the list of
currencies known to Finance::Quote. It returns a hash reference where the keys
are ISO currency codes and the values are hash references containing metadata
about the currency. 

A constraint is a key name and either  a scalar or regular expression.  A
currency satisfies the constraint if its metadata hash contains the constraint
key and the value of that metadata field matches the regular expression or
contains the constraint value as a substring.  If the metadata field is an
array, then it satisfies the constraint if any value in the array satisfies the
constraint.

## parse\_csv

    my @list = Finance::Quote::parse_csv($string);

`parse_csv` is a utility function for splitting a comma separated value string
into a list of terms, treating double-quoted strings that contain commas as a
single value.

## parse\_csv\_semicolon

    my @list = Finance::Quote::parse_csv_semicolon($string);

`parse_csv` is a utility function for splitting a semicolon separated value string
into a list of terms, treating double-quoted strings that contain semicolons as a
single value.
